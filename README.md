# Object Detection Using YOLO Tutorial

Welcome to my Object Detection Using YOLO Tutorial! In this tutorial, 
you'll learn how to create your own object detection system that can be applied to any game 
by following a few steps. I've provided detailed instructions in the Jupyter notebooks. 
However, if you'd like a step-by-step video tutorial, please check out the video below. 


This video will not only walk you through each step of the process but also includes a real-time execution using Diablo 2 as an example.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is divided into four parts, each covering a step in creating an object detection system:

- **Creating a Dataset**

- **Labeling Images**

- **Model Training**

- **Object Detection**

## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Open a command line in the repository folder.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing:

```jupyter notebook .```

5. Execute the step-by-step instructions provided in the Jupyter notebooks.

    - On that tutorial, you can find instructions on running the detector in a live video and also obtaining metrics for your trained model performance. If you want more details about the training process, I recommend reading his Medium article.

These references served as resources in the creation of this guide, and I extend my gratitude to their creators.
